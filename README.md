## Project Backstory
At the end of July 2020, I was looking for some preparation before my upcoming school semester that September. I hadn't done any programming related work in about a month, and was looking to get comfortable with doing all my work at home, since all of my classes were exclusively online because of COVID-19.

The semesters before the development period of this project, I exclusively kept track of all my assignments in a .txt file where I manually kept track of assignments. It was suboptimal and clearly not very nice to use. I searched online for a scheduling application to use, but couldn't find any that I actually wanted to use. I found all of them either annoying/too-complicated-for-no-reason or not free. I decided against using any, and continued using a .txt file for the remainder of my Spring 2020 semester.

I remembered this when I was brainstorming projects at the end of July 2020, and decided to go with it. I enjoyed making simple GUIs in past school related projects, and hadn't made a real program in Python yet and was looking to get comfortable with it. Thus, here we are.

I worked on this primarily from **8/2/20 - 9/12/20**, as well as a final important feature filled updated on **10/13/20**. After this last update, I ceased development on this project due to school work as well as the unorganized structure mistakes I made when creating the program. On 5/14/21 I put a slightly modified version on the GitHub repo that is more appropriate for non-developer use/viewing, as well as creating this very document!

This project not only taught me how to *not* develop my programs, but ended up creating an application that I **use everyday during every semester since**.

## Development Details
Throughout the project, I made an initiative to write down all my different thoughts and paths taken as I developed each day. I tried to write all important developments of the day, and then set goals for the next day. This repeated until I had something that resembled what I sought out to make. From there, I would just add what I found would make the application better for the user on that particular day.

So, all of the documents that I wrote everyday can be viewed as a pdf at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W_TjXmqgkiu7DLBikBpMez5A1sB0sGgT/view?usp=sharing. This should detail what my thought process was during development.

## What I Learned From All Those Mistakes
Here is an excerpt that I wrote on 9/7/20 on my findings from working on the project and making different mistakes along the way. I still think it surmises my feelings on how the project went and what mistakes I learned from.

 - Planning is key: planning is everything. You won't really have to write any code at all if you already think about general operations and structure of the program. Which leads into the next thing.
 - Staying organized takes precedent over everything else. Making exceptions and makeshift ideas are okay when trying to get something to work for the first time; do not leave them in! Maintaining stable code becomes more and more difficult as time goes on. At this point, I feel like I should drop this project because of how awful it is at this point.
 - Keeping a log of ideas was very helpful and important in letting my ideas flow. Also just like having a daily log of my activities.
 - Although at times it feels like you don't know where to start, just do it in anyway at all. Honestly halting too much because you want to do something 'right' will be more time consuming and detrimental. Make the thing. Improve upon it. Keep doing that.

Lastly, in reference to this project. Yes, it has flaws. It's a giant mess, actually. But, I've become comfortable in Python (3), and have had a more independent experience in making simple GUIs. In the process, I made a program that I'll use for the next 6 months and is something I'm happy I've made.

**To summarize:
Planning and foresight is important.
Keeping your code OOP and organized is top priority.
Write a log of things getting done. It helps me a lot.
Start right now.**

## Brief *actual* readme
The structure of the program is based on the user's **Classes**, each of which have respective **Assignments**. This is what the entire program revolves around. 

Each class is defined by multiple things:
 - Class Name
 - Respective Color (Corresponds on main assignment feed)
 - Scheduled Date/Time of class

Each Assignment is defined by slightly more things:
 - Relevant Class of the Assignment
 - Title
 - Description
 - Scheduled Date/Time of class

Assignments can also be "*completed*", which crosses out the assignment in the main feed, and is unable to be interacted with from then on.

Otherwise, the program is entirely self-explanatory. Selecting from the main feed works as you'd assume, and you can modify the assignment you choose appropriately.

The program does not auto-save, you must save via File>Save or File>Save & Exit.
